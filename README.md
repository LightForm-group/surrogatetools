# SurrogateTools

SurrogateTools is a wrapper package that combines several Python packages into a single unified framework which allows for the quick implementation of surrogate models using Gaussian processes (GP) using the Scikit-Learn implementation. 
This allows for the use of global sensitivity analysis through Sobol' indices implemented in Scipy, as well as Bayesian inference through PyMC. This is a robust framework which may take any vector input and predict some
vector output, assuming that the dimensionality is relatively low.
